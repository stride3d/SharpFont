### Cross-platform FreeType bindings for .NET

SharpFont is a library that provides FreeType bindings for .NET. It's MIT
licensed to make sure licensing doesn't get in the way of using the library in
your own projects. Unlike [Tao.FreeType][1], SharpFont provides the full
public API and not just the basic methods needed to render simple text.
Everything from format-specific APIs to the caching subsystem are included.

SharpFont simplifies the FreeType API in a few ways:

 - The error codes that most FreeType methods return are converted to
   exceptions.
 - Since the return values are no longer error codes, methods with a single
   `out` parameter are returned instead.
 - Most methods are instance methods instead of static methods. This avoids
   unnecessary redundancy in method calls and creates an API with a .NET
   look-and-feel.

For example, a regular FreeType method looks like this:

```C
Face face;
int err = FT_New_Face(library, "./myfont.ttf", 0, &face);
```

The equivalent code in C# with SharpFont is:

```CSharp
Face face = new Face(library, "./myfont.ttf");
```

## Quick Start

### NuGet
SharpFont is available on [NuGet][2]. It can be installed by issuing the
following command in the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package SharpFont
```

### From Source
Clone the repository and compile the solution. Copy `SharpFont.dll` to your
project and include it as a reference. On Windows, you must include a compiled
copy of FreeType2 as `freetype6.dll` in the project's output directory. It is
possible to rename the file by changing the filename constant in
[FT.Internal.cs][3] and recompile. On Linux and OSX (and any other Mono
supported platform), you must also copy `SharpFont.dll.config` to the
project's output directory.

Two extensions for Visual Studio make it easy to follow the coding format in 
this project and prevent lots of spurious whitespace changes.
The [.editorconfig](http://editorconfig.org/) file in the project works with the
[EditorConfig](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/c8bccfe2-650c-4b42-bc5c-845e21f96328) 
extension and the [Format document on Save](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/3ea1c920-69c4-441f-9979-ccc2752dac56) 
extension makes it basically automatic.

#### Mono
With the removal of the `WIN64` configurations, the included `Makefile` is
effectively redundant. However, you can still build SharpFont by calling
`make` while in the root directory of this project.

#### FreeType
A large number of FreeType builds for Windows are now available in the
[SharpFont.Dependencies][4] repository.

## Known Issues

While SharpFont is fully compatible with and runs on 64-bit Windows, it relies
on a patch for FreeType to do this. This patch is already included in
[SharpFont.Dependencies/freetype2][5]. You do not need to worry about this as
a user of the library. If you are compiling FreeType from source, you can find
the patch and instructions at the same location.
